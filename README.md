## Projects:

### Predicting Boston Housing Prices
  In this project, I worked on Boston Housing [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/), which consists of 506 entries representing 14 different features for houses in Boston. Decision Tree was used as regressor to predict the price of a house with a given features. The flow of the project was as following :
  1. Data Exploration  : Calculate Statistics and Observe the features
  2. Developing a Model :  Define a Performance Metric and check Goodness of Fit. 
  3. Analyzing Model Performance : Use simple and complex learning curves, and observe the bias-variance tradeoff
  4. Evaluating Model Performance:  Use Grid-Search and cross-validation
  5. Making Predictions : Test uing the test sub-dataset, and discuss the applicability of such application in real-life
  
### Finding Donors for Charity
  In this project, I worked on Charity Donors  [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income), which consists of 48842 entries representing 14 different features for people income. Different classifers were used to classify if a person is making more than 50,000 or not.The flow of the project was as following :
  1. Data Exploration : Calculate Statistics and Observe the features
  2. Preparing the Data : Transforming Skewed Continuous Features, Normalizing Numerical Features
  3. Evaluating Model Performance : Metrics and the Naive Predictor
  4. Supervised Learning Models:  Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB), Decision Trees, Ensemble Methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNeighbors), Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDC), Logistic Regression
  5. Initial Model Evaluation : Test uing the test sub-dataset
  6. Improving Results : Choosing the Best Model, Model Tuing
  7. Final Model Evaluation
  8. Feature Importance and Selection

### Dog Breed Classifier

### Creating Customer Segments
